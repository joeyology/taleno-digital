          Joey is an outstanding data engineer. He is intimate with all the data
          modeling best practices, and provided outstanding operational support
          for our Data Lake initiative. His attention to detail, and
          professionalism in designing, building, and supporting our Data Lake
          on both the Redshift and Snowflake platforms reflected credit upon
          himself and our team. I would work with Joey again given the
          opportunity.

          It was easy working with Jose Mari at Polytechnic University of the
          Philippines MsC in Information Technology. He is a good presenter and
          a subject matter expert in the field of Data Analysis and reporting.
          He helped me with several documents that we were building and added a
          lot of feedback to the competitive analysis when we really needed
          more. He was a pleasure to work with and I hope to work with him again
          outside of PUP as I graduate this May. If there are any projects that
          I need help with, Iâ€™m glad to contact him and work together.

          I am highly recommending Jose Mari. He was one of my favorite
          developers to work with. Joey as we call him has a great mix of
          technical and business/communication skills. He didn't just develop
          applications, he learned/understood what the business really wanted
          and he developed solutions. He is very much a team player and very
          easy to work with.
