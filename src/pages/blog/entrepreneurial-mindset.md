  Having an Entrepreneurial Mindset in a corporate setting is being able to
  think like a business man even if currently employed. In practical
  application, it's taking that something that is really irritating at work (or
  the pain points) and think of a solution to that particular problem.

### Context

I had an opportunity to attend our company's first ever Digital National Conference as we adapt in this Covid-19 crisis. And one of the main topics was about having an Entrepreneurial Mindset.

So I'm not an expert in this subject matter, I just want to share what I remember (from the speaker, Mr. RJ Ledesma) and how can I apply it my career. And what's in it for [taleno.digital](https://taleno.digital/)?

### As far as I remember...

Having an Entrepreneurial Mindset in a corporate setting is being able to think like a business man even if currently employed. In practical application, it's taking that something that is really irritating you at work (or the pain points) and think of a solution to that particular problem.

That all sounds great and psychological but with all the work load in my plate, I can only do so much. And I'm not great in living in a psychological world.

### Application

The idea is great however, I just need to find out how to apply it. Since I can't do this at work effectively, why not try to be an entrepreneur myself? No psychology needed. Just pure reality.

Hence, that's how [taleno.digital](https://taleno.digital/) is born. ðŸš€
