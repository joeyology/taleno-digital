excerpt: Having an Entrepreneurial Mindset in a corporate setting is being able to
  think like a business man even if currently employed. In practical application,
  it's taking that something that is really irritating at work (or the pain points)
  and think of a solution to that particular problem.

### Context

I had an opportunity to attend our company's first ever Digital National Conference as we adapt in this Covid-19 crisis. And one of the main topics was about having an Entrepreneurial Mindset. 

So I'm not an expert in this subject matter, I just want to share what I remember (from the speaker, Mr. RJ Ledesma) and how can I apply it my career and in [taleno.digital](https://taleno.digital/).

### As far as I remember
