### Let's do this!

As a result of my journey to gain an [entrepreneurial mindset](https://taleno.digital/blog/entrepreneurial-mindset/) through a real life example (by trying to be an entrepreneur myself), I'm pushing for my super overdue desire to build a [SaaS company](https://taleno.digital/about/).

### What's the strategy?

Simple. I'll just join the [#BuildInPublic](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BuildInPublic&src=typed_query) bandwagon in the Twitter world. I don't know the rules yet (though I don't think there are rules). Is it even possible to share every detail of the progress publicly? Maybe. Anyhow, this is the thing for the makers at the moment of this writing so let's get into it!

### Imposter syndrome attack...

The funny thing is... I even barely started and doubt already attacked me without a warning! I don't have another tweet about #BuildInPublic after [my last tweet](https://twitter.com/talenodigital/status/1365309127480668163). ðŸ¤£

Oh the joy of doing something what you love. ðŸ¥°
