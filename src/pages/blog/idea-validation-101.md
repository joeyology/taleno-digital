### Recap

Previously, I shared a very tactical (pun intended) strategy on how I'm going to approach this No-code SaaS Journey which is to [#BuildInPublic](https://taleno.digital/blog/building-in-public/). And also mentioned about my doubts upfront. For this blog post, let me share to you how I deal with my idea.

### Idea Validation

I asked the twitter world if there are any [idea validation tool](https://twitter.com/talenodigital/status/1364163511761334272) already available. I'm grateful for the responses even though it's not much.

However, my need to validate my idea still stands. Which is a different idea by the way and not related to making Data Storytelling easy.

I can't afford to start working on a No-code SaaS Project and later on knowing that I don't have a market for it. This is my hard lesson #1.

### Google Key Planner

Upon researching (which is a very important step), I found this [tips & tricks](https://templatic.com/tips-tricks/start-online-directory/) in starting an online directory. Their #1 tip is to use Google Key Planner to see related keywords to the idea and check the number of **Average Monthly Searches** and the status of the **Competition**.

I just settled with this approach and this helped me to at least have a sense that my idea has some traction and has an opportunity. If I waited for the perfect idea validation tool, I'm probably stuck as of this moment. That's my hard lesson #2.

### Realization

This is not a guarantee for success as I believe that there are lots of brilliant advices out there. But here's my takeaways:

* **Research**. There's definitely something helpful in the internet just to start off.
* **Settle**. If you've found that helpful resource, stick to it and try. Do not get overloaded with information.

In my [next blog post](https://taleno.digital/blog/buildinpublic-first-money-mistake/), I'll be sharing about my initial mistakes and it costs me some money. ðŸ˜…
