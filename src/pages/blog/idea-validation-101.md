### Recap

Previously, I shared a very tactical (pun intended) strategy on how I'm going to approach this No-code SaaS Journey which is to [#BuildInPublic](https://taleno.digital/blog/building-in-public/). And also mentioned about my doubts upfront. For this blog post, let me share to you how I deal with my idea.

### Idea Validation

I asked the twitter world if there are any [idea validation tool](https://twitter.com/talenodigital/status/1364163511761334272) already available. I'm grateful for the responses even though it's not much.

However, my need to validate my idea still stands. Which is a different idea by the way and not related to making Data Storytelling easy.

I can't afford to start working on a No-code SaaS Project and later on knowing that I don't have a market for it. This is my hard lesson #1.

### Google Key Planner

Upon researching (which is a very important step), I found this [tips & tricks](https://templatic.com/tips-tricks/start-online-directory/) in starting an online directory. Their #1 tip is to use Google Key Planner to see related keywords to the idea and check the number of **Average Monthly Searches** and the status of the **Competition**.

I just settled with this approach and this helped me to at least have a sense that my idea has some traction and has an opportunity. If I waited for the perfect idea validation tool, I'm probably stuck as of this moment. That's my hard lesson #2.

### Realization

This is not a guarantee for success as I believe that there are lots of brilliant advices out there. But here's my takeaways:

* **Research**. There's definitely something helpful in the internet just to start off. 
* **Settle**. If you've found that helpful resource, stick to it and try. Do not get overloaded with information.

In my next blog post, I'll be sharing about my initial mistakes and it costs me some money. ðŸ˜…
