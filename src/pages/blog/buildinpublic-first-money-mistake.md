### Recap

Previously I shared on how I go about my [very practical way that helped me have a sense of confidence with my idea](https://taleno.digital/blog/idea-validation-101/) that allow me to move forward and not to get stuck.

Now, let's jump right into my initial mistakes! ðŸ™„

### Buying a this-looks-cool-to-me domain

My first idea a global marketplace for those who are looking for a service nearby. For example, my toilet suddenly got broken and I need someone to help fix it. Along with this line.

And the result is... **findyourlocal.services**. Woohoo!

So I went back researching with Google Key Planner and suddenly my wife told me that I could filter my keyword searching to Philippines only. In short, I missed that part when I bought the domain. It's too late!

But then I needed to carry on. I was still in the hope of using **findyourlocal.services** because "I think" it would work. But that's what I think. It's not what the GKP is telling me.

### Youtube

I did another research but this time in Youtube. I found this great video that allowed the maker to build a directory listing **on his area** during the pandemic.

Notice the bold words. 

Those words made me bought another domain. Still on the same day. ðŸ˜¶

So that's how [davaocity.life](https://davaocity.life/) was born! And thankfully this is much cheaper than the first one.

But it didn't end here...

### Copy cat syndrome attack

I watched that youtube video again in the morning and it made me want to buy another domain that's inspired by the example. 

Boom! Just after a few seconds the third domain was born and it's called **wedeliverph.com**. Because I'm a Filipino and Philippines is my country or area. And I want to niche down on delivery services.

And then late realization strikes. I realized that [davaocity.life](https://davaocity.life/) is already perfect for the wordpress theme I got from my no-code incubator course, [kibi.one](https://kibi.one/).

### In conclusion

I ended up having 3 domains and that cost me money. But end of the day, I am still grateful because I learned a lot from these mistakes.

Mistakes is not a failure. It's real education IF we learn from it. ðŸ˜Š

In the next blog post, I'll be talking about how I build [davaocity.life](https://davaocity.life/)!
